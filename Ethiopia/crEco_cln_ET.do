/*******************************************************************************
* Change log
* 				Updated
*				version
* Date 			number 	Name			What Changed
2024-10-02		1.01	MK Trimner		Reordered M3 variables to align with instrument
*										Added call to derived variable program at the end of the program
*										Saved as ec_ET_COMPLETE dataset
*										confirmed that all date variables are in a date format and not string
*										Added code to format all dates in proper format and to add special missing values per the questionnaire for values of 888,999 and 998
* 										Added char to all variables to show the original variable in a note
* 2024-10-08	1.02	MK Trimner		Added char that contains the module for each original variable for codebook purposes		
*										Corrected typo for value label m2_203h, m2_205c, m2_interview_restarted, breathing, m3_YNDKRF, m4_conclusion_dead_baby and m5_feeding
* 2024-10-30	1.03	MK Trimner		Renaming variable to alsign with all other countries m1_203_et - removed the _et as it applies to other countries as well
